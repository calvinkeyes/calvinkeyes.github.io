<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a Master's student at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) studying Computer Science and Engineering. My academic interests are in hardware: computer architecture, digital design, and vlsi.</p>
<p>I recently graduated from UCSC with my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering.</p>
<p>I am also apart of the Men's Basketball team at UCSC. Go Slugs!</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>I got to work on a bunch of cool projects as an undergrad.</p>
<p>For one project, I explored instruction level parallelism using loop unrolling. The blue line represents an unrolled loop. We see about a 1.4x speedup over the baseline. This makes sense because we are getting rid of unnecessary comparison operations. However, we see a significant speed up when we interleave instructions that are independent of each other. This means we are better able to fill our data pipeline. We see a max of about 5.7x speedup when we carefully write out the code!</p>

<p>In another project, I designed my own six transistor SRAM cell. Throughout the quarter, we learned various electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Putting all of the tools together, I designed and tested the performance of an SRAM cell. The layout of my cell is below.</p>

<h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
<p>When I'm not working, I enjoy playing basketball, reading world history books, and going on hikes.</p>
